Hello %s,

Your course %s has been recognized by the WPI Office of Sustainability for teaching sustainability topics! 

Because your course is deemed sustainable, we would like to feature it in our project! We are one of the IQP teams that were planning to go abroad, but due to the outbreak, must stay home in the United States. We are now completing our project remotely for WPI’s Office of Sustainability.  Our project centralizes around making an online platform that provides faculty with resources to help them provide quality content for teaching sustainability.
The platform will also provide students with a breakdown of what sustainability topics are covered over D Term, and which classes cover those topics.  

Due to the unique nature of IQPs this term, we would truly appreciate your help to gather as much information about sustainability in WPI courses as we can!  If you could  answer the questions below regarding your course at your earliest convenience that would be great. 

Did you know you were on a list that deems your course covers sustainability topics?

We are categorizing sustainability topics by the United Nations’ Sustainability Development Goals, which are attached to this email for your reference.
Do you cover any sustainability topics relating to those goals in your course? 

Thank you so much for your help in gathering information!

Best,
Emily Baker, Rui Huang, and Akash Shaji
