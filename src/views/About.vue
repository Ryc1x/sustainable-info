      Hi, We are the Sustainablity Studies group! This is a deliverable for our
      IQP! We live in an age where the world seems increasingly dismayed in
      saving the environment. Many don’t seem to understand the urgency of
      situation we’re in and seem content with what little ‘progress’ we’ve made
      so far. We need to be taking care of the world for future generations, and
      as such it's vital that we educate young people on topics relating to
      sustainability as they stand to lose the most from it. WPI first years are
      expected to make a 4-year plan that maps their schedules to a set of
      graduation requirements. Unfortunately, while designing these plans,
      learning about sustainability is not a factor in their selections. The
      Climate Crisis, increased poverty and inequalities emphasize how essential
      a sustainability education is. AASHE explains that “the classroom (is) the
      true battleground for change,” but WPI students do not realize how many
      WPI courses cover sustainability, and some WPI faculty lack the resources
      to integrate sustainability into their curricula. Our project aims to
      bridge these gaps to make WPI curricula more sustainably focused and to
      show students what sustainability topics are taught. We interviewed
      faculty who already teach sustainability related curriculum and surveyed
      their students to find out what sustainability topics are currently being
      taught at WPI, and what topics students want to learn about. We used the
      information gathered through the interviews and surveys in order to
      generate our deliverable: a website that allows for students to filter
      through sustainable courses by subject or sustainability topic and for
      faculty to have easy access to ways sustainability can be integrated in
      curriculum, potential help for doing so, and the student interest in
      particular topics or delivery methods.
