    <h1>The Reason</h1>
    <p>
      While humanity at large has made great strides in various fields such as medicine, education and life expectancy, this progress is not without great cost to our world.
      We need to be taking care of the world for future generations, and as such it's vital that we educate young people on topics relating to sustainability because, as a WPI professor explains, “[they] are going to be the ones to deal with it.”

      WPI first years are expected to make a 4-year plan that maps their schedules to a set of graduation requirements.
      Unfortunately, while designing these plans, learning about sustainability is not a factor in their selections.
      The Climate Crisis, increased poverty and inequalities emphasize how essential learning about sustainability is.
      The Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education explains that “the classroom (is) the true battleground for change,” but WPI students do not realize how many courses cover sustainability, and some WPI faculty lack the resources to integrate sustainability into their curricula (“Ten Ways to Integrate Sustainability into the Curriculum,” 2013).

      Our project aims to promote sustainability in education for WPI faculty and students.
      We interviewed faculty who already teach sustainability themed curriculum and surveyed their students to find out what sustainability topics are currently being covered at WPI and what topics students want to learn about.
      We used this information to generate our deliverable: a website that serves both students and faculty. It allows for students to filter through sustainable courses by subject or sustainability topic.
      It allows faculty to have easy access to ways sustainability can be integrated in curriculum, potential help for doing so, and the student interest in sustainability topics and delivery methods.
